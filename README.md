# Mircowave Engineering, project: End_coupled filter
*Tommaso Dezuanni*: 105566079

**This project was presented by Tommaso Dezuanni on 17/06/2024 for the exam call of "Microwave Engineering", an academic course held by Professor Guido Gentili at Politecnico of Milano**
Thie presentation was rewarded with the grade of 26/30.

*Description of the files*:
1. "end_coupled_filter.pptx" is a presentation realized exploiting a template available on the DEIB website, the Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering of Politecnico of Milano.
2. "2011062010032057680" it's a pdf of a practical lecture of Professor Tzu-Lin Wu, at the National University of Taiwan. The first exercise shows how to approach to derive the capacitors in the equivalent circuit for the gaps and the dimensioning of resonator's lenghts.
3. "3.11 _Microstrip_Line" is a pdf created to save a screenshot of a page of a book written by Professor Steven W. Ellingson about the topic, at the time working for the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. In particular, I used this document to justify the approximation applied for the dielectric constant. NOTE: in AWR there is the TxLine Tool that permits the same calculation, but I didn't know it.
